# Ground cover forecasting

We implemented both [ConvLSTM](https://github.com/rudolfwilliam/satellite_image_forecasting) and [PredRNN](https://github.com/thuml/predrnn-pytorch) to predict future ground cover based on previous trends. Auxiliary data includes rainfall, temperature, 
soil moisture and runoff. 

We use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for the implementation.
